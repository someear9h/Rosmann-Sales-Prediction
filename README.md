## Project Overview
This project aims to build a sales forecasting application for Rossmann Stores using historical data. The application provides an end-to-end solution for:
- **Data ingestion**, feature engineering, and preprocessing.
- Training and deployment of a **Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost)** for accurate sales predictions.
- Interactive user interface via a Flask web application.

The problem stems from Rossmann store managers needing to predict daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Sales are influenced by factors such as promotions, holidays, competition, and seasonal trends. The goal is to forecast sales while considering these influences.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rossmann-sales-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask App**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.

## Model Training Workflow
### Steps:
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Load raw datasets.
   - Split into training and testing datasets.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Perform feature scaling, encoding, and time-based transformations.
   - Save the preprocessor as `preprocessor.pkl`.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train using **XGBoost** for accurate predictions.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
   - Save the best model as `model.pkl`.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using RMSE and other relevant metrics.

## Data Preprocessing Techniques
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived features such as promotions, holidays, and seasonal trends.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputation techniques for null values.
- **Time-Based Transformations**: Extracted year, month, and day from date fields.
- **Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables into numerical formats.

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures prediction errors.


---

## Flask Application
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/`: Displays the home page.
  - `/predictsales`: Accepts user inputs and provides predictions.

- **Backend**:
  - Integrates the pre-trained model (`model.pkl`) and preprocessor (`preprocessor.pkl`).
  - Uses `predict_pipeline.py` for inference.

---

## Frontend Development
- **HTML**:
  - Clean layout for user input and result display.
- **CSS**:
  - Added styling to improve user experience.

---

## Deployment
The project is deployed as a Flask application and can be further enhanced by deploying it on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a sales forecasting pipeline, combining:
- Real-world data analysis and machine learning model development.
- Interactive deployment with Flask.
- Feature engineering and time-series analysis.
