# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts daily sales for Rossmann stores using historical data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set provided in the [Rossmann Store Sales competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).
The dataset contains data for over 1,000 stores, influenced by factors like promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

## Problem Statement
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. Currently, individual store managers predict daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. However, these predictions often vary in accuracy. This project aims to:
- Build a robust model to predict sales more accurately.
- Automate the sales prediction process for consistency across stores.

The dataset contains:
- Historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores.
- Details on store closures, promotions, holidays, and other factors.

**Challenge**: Predict the "Sales" column for the test set, considering the impact of all these factors.

## Features of the Project
### 1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
- **Handling Missing Values**: 
  - Missing numerical values (e.g., `CompetitionDistance`) are imputed based on domain logic.
  - Missing categorical values are imputed with the most frequent category.
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - New features are created to capture seasonality, holiday effects, and promotions.
  - Categorical features are encoded using OneHotEncoding.

### 2. **Modeling**
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: 
  - Utilizes `XGBoost` (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) for robust, scalable predictions.
  - Parameters: `n_estimators=100`, `learning_rate=0.2`, `max_depth=10`, etc.
- **Pipeline**: 
  - Automates preprocessing (imputation, scaling, encoding) and model training.

### 3. **Tools and Techniques**
- **Gradient Boosting**: The XGBoost algorithm is used to handle large-scale, structured data.
- **Version Control**: Ensures reproducibility and consistent development.
- **Pickle Serialization**: The trained model is saved and reused for predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle:
- **Train Data**: Contains historical sales data with features like promotions, holidays, and store information.
- **Test Data**: Features for which predictions need to be made.
- **Target Column**: `Sales`

**Dataset Link**: [Rossmann Store Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data)

## Workflow
### Step 1: Data Ingestion
- Load training and test datasets.
- Split the data into training and validation sets.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (e.g., `CompetitionDistance`).
- Encode categorical variables.
- Scale numerical features for uniformity.

### Step 3: Feature Engineering
- Create new features such as:
  - Year, month, day of the week.
  - Holiday indicators.
  - Days since competition began.
  
### Step 4: Model Training
- Train the `XGBRegressor` model with hyperparameter tuning.
- Save the trained model using `pickle`.

### Step 5: Prediction and Evaluation
- Generate predictions for the test set.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

### Required Libraries
Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rossmann-sales-prediction.git
cd rossmann-sales-prediction
```

### 2. Run the Pipeline
- **Train the Model**: 
  Run the `data_ingestion.py` and `data_transformation.py` scripts to preprocess data and train the model.
- **Save the Model**: 
  Save the trained model as a `pickle` file for reuse.

### 3. Prediction
Load the saved model to make predictions on new data:
```python
import pickle

# Load the model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

```

## Results
- The model successfully predicts daily sales for Rossmann stores.
- RMSE: **(Add evaluation metric)**

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost using grid search.
- Incorporate more external data (e.g., weather conditions, economic indicators).
- Experiment with other machine learning models for better performance.
